# Bank tech test

This is a sample tech test provided by Makers Academy, completed during my tenth week of the bootcamp.

To run this code, fork and clone this repository, then run

```
rspec --init
bundle install
```

## Specification

### Requirements

- You should be able to interact with your code via a REPL like IRB or the JavaScript console. (You don't need to implement a command line interface that takes input from STDIN.)
- Deposits, withdrawal.
- Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing.
- Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).

### Acceptance criteria

**Given** a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012  
**And** a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012  
**And** a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012  
**When** she prints her bank statement  
**Then** she would see

```

## Planning

I'll need:

- a method for depositing money
- a method for withdrawing money
- a way of keeping track of what the current balance is
- a way of keeping track of all of the transactions, to be printed out with the statement
- a method for printing the full bank statement

## Edge Cases

What happens when a bank account goes below 0? Is there an overdraft limit?
What happens if a deposit or withdrawal is conducted in a different month? Different year?
